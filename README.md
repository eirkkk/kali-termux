# Install Linux on Termux Android

This installs nethunter with xfce4 desktop on Termux. All scripts are from Andronix, I just compose and edit them to make the installer easier and smoother. It includes:

- [x] XFCE4 Desktop

- [x] Chroot
- [x] Audio Support

## Installation

Copy and paste this command to Termux:

### Linux OS 

- [x] Kali

```bash
curl -o setup https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eirkkk/kali-termux/main/setup && chmod +x setup && ./setup && rm setup
```

After installation, on Termux, you can execute this command to run nethunter:
